# python-api-challenge

Origional files were provided my UW Madison.

Referenced previous class activities from week 6. 

I tried adding the .gitignore file but I am not 100% sure if it worked. I will add the file directly to book camp if access is needed. 

First I worked on the WeatherPy. Attaching the API ans retrieving my API code. I used the data to model multiple different linear regression models and make a couple scatter plots. I found that the majority of the graphs did not have great correlation but 2 of them had great correlation. 

Second I worked on the VacationPy. I imported the csv and created a dataframe. I then plot the lat and lon with correlation to the humidity represented in marker size. I then filtered the previous data for my ideal weather conditions, dropped unnecessary data and used that data to create a new dataframe colled hotel_df. After I found the first hotels that were located within 10000 meters from my coodinates and printed the data. I then created another map plot to show the hotel name and country as well as a hover message that shows the hotel and country. 

The plots from WeatherPy were exported to output.
